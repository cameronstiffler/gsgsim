# === MACHINE EFFECTS (Wave A) ==================================================
# Non-invasive runtime for machine-readable card effects. This block is designed
# to be standalone and safe: nothing else in the engine has to import from here.
# You can call `run_machine_effects(gs, source_goon, ability, chooser)` from the
# ability execution point to apply effects if `ability["effects"]` is present.
#
# Wave A coverage:
# - alter_wind (±N or "X")
# - prevent_unwind
# - disable_abilities, disable_contribution
# - destroy
# - retire_on_destroy, return_to_hand_on_destroy (registered as status flags)
# - grant_resist
# - cannot_be_targeted, must_be_destroyed_first
# - search_deck, draw_cards
# Targets supported: self, any, ally_all, opponent_all, ally_all_except:self,
# all_opponent_playergoons, two_goons, three_goons, card_name:*, dead_pool
# Durations: instant, until_end_of_turn, next_turn, next_unwind, persistent
#
# NOTE: This block never prints; UI owns messaging. It mutates GameState and
# returns a list of "prompts" when user choices are needed (e.g., pick targets).
